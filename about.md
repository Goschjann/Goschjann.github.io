I am a final year PhD student within Prof. Bernd Bischl's [Statistical Learning and Data Science Group](http://www.compstat.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/) at LMU Munich. As part of my PhD, I was fortunate to spend some time as visiting researcher within Prof. Zsolt Kira's [RIPL Lab](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~zk15/) at Georgia Tech working on the use of pairwise constraints in weakly supervised learning settings. 

My research is centered around 'Learning from Limited Labeled Data', aka Machine Learning settings with a low level of supervision/ oracle annotations. It is connected to Manifold Learning, Semi-supervised Learning, Self-supervised Learning, PU Learning and Constrained Clustering.

Next to my LMU affiliation, I am a senior researcher within the [Fraunhofer IIS ADA Lovelace Center](https://www.scs.fraunhofer.de/de/forschung/ada-center.html), a joint AI initiative of the Fraunhofer IIS, LMU and FAU. Therein, we translate AI into industrial practice and overcome the hurdles of applying latest semi-supervised learning methods to settings beyond ImageNet with our industrial partners. 

During my master's I was involved in a project using Machine Learning for Parkinson's Disease Monitoring. Despite working on other applications now professionally, I kept my interest in the ML4Healthcare space and take part in [competitions](https://www.michaeljfox.org/news/mjff-and-sage-bionetworks-announce-winners-beat-pd-dream-challenge) and [research activities](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.20.21265298v1) in this area on a private note. 

I am also fascinated by the recent advances in multi-modal models used for [generative art](https://multimodal.art) and spent some evenings prompting and tweeking these models.
